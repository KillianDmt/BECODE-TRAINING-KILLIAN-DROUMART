# How does the internet works ? 

Whenever most people think of the internet, this is what comes to mind. The internet is not a bubble cloud, event in the new age of cloud computing. The whole fuzzy cloud picture was created by people more concerned about job security than education.

The Internet is a wire, actually buried in the ground. It might be fiber optics, copper or occasionnaly beamed to satellites or through cell phone networks, but the internet is simply a wire. The Internet is useful because two computers connected directly to this wire can communicate. A server is a special computer connected directly to the Internet, and web pages are files on that server's hard drive. Every server has a unique Internet Protocol Adress, or IP address. Just like a postal address, IP address help computers find each other. We also give them names like google.com, facebook.com,... Your computer at home is not a server because it is not connected directly to the internet. 

Computers you and I use every day are called clients because they're connected indirectly to the internet through an internet service provider. 

Whenever an email, picture, or web page travels across the internet, compurters breaj the information into smaller pieces called packets. When information reaches its destination, the packets are reassembled in their original order to make a picture, email, web page,...
Everything connected to the Internet directly or indirectly has an IP Adress. Anywhere two or more parts of the Internet intersect, there's a piece of equipement called router. Routers direct your packets around the Internet, helping each packet get one step closer to its destination. Every time you visit a website, Upwards of 10 to 15 routers may help your packets find their way to and from your computer. Each time a packet reaches a new computer/router it gets a new layer (the IP adress of the system). Then when the server sends back information, it creates packets with those identical layer. 

As the packet makes its way over the Internet back to your computer, each router unwraps a layer to discover where to send the packet next until it reaches your computer.
